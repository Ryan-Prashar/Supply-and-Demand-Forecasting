# Supply-and-Demand-Forecasting
This project is a Supply and Demand Forecasting Tool that uses historical data to predict future demand and supply using Python and MySQL. The tool is designed to help businesses make informed decisions on inventory and resource planning.

# Project Overview
This tool connects to a MySQL database to retrieve historical demand data, uses an ARIMA model to forecast future demand, and visualizes the results in Python. By predicting future demand, this project can assist in optimizing resource allocation, inventory control, and supply chain efficiency.

# Features
1. Data retrieval from a MySQL database.
2. Time series forecasting using ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average).
3. Visualization of historical and forecasted data.
4. Adjustable forecast period for flexibility.

# Technologies Used

1. Python: Main programming language for data manipulation, forecasting, and visualization.
2. MySQL: Relational database for storing and managing historical demand and supply data.
3. SQLAlchemy: Library to connect and interact with the MySQL database.
4. Pandas: Data analysis library for data preparation and manipulation.
5. Statsmodels: Statistical modeling library for ARIMA-based forecasting.
6. Matplotlib: Data visualization library for plotting historical and forecasted demand.

# Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
   i. Python 3.x
   ii. MySQL server
   iii. Pip package manager

# Usage

1. Update Database Credentials: Update DATABASE_USER, DATABASE_PASSWORD, and DATABASE_NAME in the Python script with your MySQL database details.

2. Run the Python Script: Execute the script to generate the forecasted demand for the next 30 days:
   $ python demand_forecast.py
   
# Output: 
The tool will display a plot with historical and forecasted demand.

# Future Improvements

1. Expand the forecasting model to incorporate supply data.
2. Add a dashboard for interactive data analysis.
3. se more complex machine learning models for forecasting.
4. Automate the data refresh and forecasting intervals.
